Hi, I’m Lauti! I received my MS in Urban Informatics from Northeastern University (Boston, MA) and my BA in Economics from Universidad Nacional de La Plata. I’m currently working as a Data Analyst at the Modernization Secretary at the Chief of Cabinet of Ministers of the Argentine Nation.

I love to talk to people and I'm interested in new technologies and applications. Feel free to shot me a message and we can arrange a time to chat!
